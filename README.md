# React-projects

Collection place for my React practice projects.

## Countries

App that lists all the countries and shows some data about them. The list is paginated and searchable. I used the [REST Countries](https://restcountries.eu/) API to get the countries data. The app can display the countries on the map. For this function I used the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) library, with the help of [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/).

## Best Sellers List

NY Times Best Sellers list. I used the [NY Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/) to get the list. Practicing UseState, UseEffect, Fetching from an API.

## Guitar Colelction List

Simple React list App. Practicing useState.

## Reviews App

Simple app that shows some reviews, with a pagination. For styling I used [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).
