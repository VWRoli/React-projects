# React-projects

Collection place for my React practice projects

## Guitar Colelction List

Simple React list App. Practicing useState.

## Best Sellers List

NY Times Best Sellers list. I used the [NY Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/) to get the list. Practicing UseState, UseEffect, Fetching from an API.

## Best Sellers List

Simple app that shows some reviews, with a pagination. For styling I used [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).

## Countries

App that lists all the countries and shows some data about them. The list is searchable. I used the [REST Countries](https://restcountries.eu/) API to get the data. For the search bar I used [this](https://www.emgoto.com/react-search-bar/) article.
