# Cryptofolio

[Live](https://cryptofolio-app.netlify.app/)

Crypto currency portfolio tracker application. Select or search the currencies you have in your portfolio. Track your assets value.

Build with React. Using useEffect, useReducer, UseCallback, useContext, React Router.

For getting the currency information I worked with the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en).

For styling I used Sass.
